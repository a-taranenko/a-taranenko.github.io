# My Personal Portfolio single-page Website

This is my portfolio website that is currently under construction. Here is the direct [link](https://a-taranenko.github.io).

## Motivation

To present myself, my ambitions, and my projects to others.

## Description

So far the website uses:
- HTML5
- CSS3
- JQuery
- Javascript
- Font Awesome styling

## Notes

- Preferred browser: Google Chrome
- Haven't accounted for window resizing effect on page content
- Haven't accounted for window width resizing effects due to a scroll bar appearance
- Some code refactoring still needs to be done in listeners.js
